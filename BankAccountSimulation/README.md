# Bank Account Simulation ðŸ’°

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a simple *Bank Account Simulation* built in *Java*.  
It demonstrates *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* concepts such as:
- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance
- Method Overriding
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

## âš™ Features
- Create an account with an initial balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money (with balance check)
- Check account balance
- View transaction history
- Savings account with interest feature

2. Navigate to the folder and compile:
javac BankAccountSimulation.java
Run the program:
java BankAccountSimulation
